# roblox-ts object-to-tree (dark theme)

I have no clue how to build the project, so you will need to edit some lines in the actual plugin code. Or you can simply download and use the plugin file in [Releases](https://github.com/charleskimbac/rbxts-Object-To-Tree-darktheme/releases).

## Edit yourself
- Get the official plugin [here](https://www.roblox.com/library/3379119778/rbxts-object-to-tree).
- Click the download button to the left of the `Open in Studio` button.
- Drag the `.rbxm` file into a Roblox Studio Explorer window.
- Replace the entire contents of `Main` with the contents of [`MAIN_DARK_THEME_EDIT.lua`](https://github.com/charleskimbac/rbxts-Object-To-Tree-darktheme/blob/master/MAIN_DARK_THEME_EDIT.lua).
	- Only a couple of lines are changed, feel free to diff the two files.
- Right click the `rbxts-object-to-tree` folder, hover over `Save / Export`, click `Save as Local Plugin`, and save.
